##INTRO
The following is a synthetic dataset of bank transactions. The goal of analyzing this dataset is to maximize detection of fraudulent transactions, while minimizing detection of false positives.

While completing EDA, I quickly realized two things:
1. There were some large values (outliers) that were skewing most of the intial distributions I created.
2. The dataset was quite large (6,362,620 rows kind of large!)
